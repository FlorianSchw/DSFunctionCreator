#### codechange function

####string or readline?






#### Logical Order of Tasks





#### 1. Arguments:branch, dsfunction-wise OR code-snippet wise


#### 2. Codeline - Replacement (Harmonised Code)


#### 3. All Codeline Examples that are not harmonised but of the same topic/check


#### 4. Find 3 in RScript of 1:length(functions in package) and replace it with 2
#### 4. This means that there has to be generic codeline, since arguments and classes etc. vary
#### 4. Is that even wrth it to automate???

#### 5. Information, such as arguments would need to be stored


##### This modification mode should be used by creating a new branch, so that the results can be checked online
##### using the commit comment option
##### However, this can be tedious when considering that a lot of "changecode" functions have to be conducted
##### for a ds.function
##### Better working in an experimental branch ==> should the function contain reeadline function to ask the user
##### to proceed / confirm that he is in an experimental branch
